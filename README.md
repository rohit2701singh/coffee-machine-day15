<h1><u></u>About the program</u></h1>

<p>
In a Python coffee machine project, the program simulates a coffee machine that offers three types of coffee, each requiring a specific amount of water, coffee beans, and milk. The machine has limited resources for these ingredients. 
</p>
<P>
When a user selects a type of coffee and inserts coins of different denominations, the program calculates the total value of the coins inserted and compares it with the cost of the selected coffee. If the user has inserted enough money, the program dispenses the coffee and calculates the change, refunding any excess amount after deducting the coffee cost. If the user hasn't inserted enough money, the program refunds the entire amount. 
</P>
<p>
Additionally, each time a coffee is dispensed, the resources in the machine are deducted based on the requirements of the selected coffee type. This ensures that the machine accurately tracks its inventory of ingredients.
